# Order of Rules: Rules are processed top-down. First match determines inclusion/exclusion.
# .env, dist, and .config are explicitly included before excluding all hidden files/directories.

!.env               # Explicitly include the '.env' file (negates the exclusion by '.*')
!dist               # Explicitly include the 'dist' directory (negates the exclusion by '.*')
!.config            # Explicitly include the '.config' directory (negates the exclusion by '.*')
!build              # Explicitly include the 'build' directory (negates the exclusion by '.*')

.*                  # Exclude all hidden files and directories (e.g., .git, .env, .gitignore)
node_modules        # Exclude the 'node_modules' directory to avoid sending unnecessary files
